Communication between nodes and control plane

Node -> Control Plane
k8s Hub and spoke API Pattern.
All API Uusage from nodes terminates at the API server.
API Server is configured to listen form remote connections on secure 443 HTTPS port with 1 or more forms of client autneticatio, authorisation.
Nodes provisioned witht the public root certificate for the cluster, to connect securly to the API server with valid client credentials.

To connect to API server, Pods can use Service account to automatically nject the public root certifiate and valid bearer token into the pod whne instntiated.
K8s service is configured with a virtual IP that's redirected via kube-proxy to the HTTPS endpoing on the API server.

Controlplane -> Node

Primary Path: From API server to the kubelet process that runs on each node in the cluster
Secondary: Service through the API server's proxy funcationality.
